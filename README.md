# Echoes Player ~(EMC)

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/orizens/echoes.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
Echoes is a great youtube player developed by [Oren Farhi](http://orizens.com).
It's fun & easy to listen or watch videos from youtube with Echoes.
What if youtube was designed to be used as music player?

Echoes Player is also available as a [Chrome Application](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/echoes-player/aaenpaopfebcmdaegggjbkhaedlbbkde)

It can be regarded as the Media Player experience for youtube listening pleasure.
